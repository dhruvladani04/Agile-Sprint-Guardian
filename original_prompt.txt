Feature Request: Smart Notification Preferences for Users
Description

Users want more control over what types of notifications they receive from the app. Currently, all notifications (reminders, updates, tips, alerts) are enabled by default with no customization options.

Problem

Users receive too many irrelevant notifications.

No way to mute certain categories (e.g., promotional alerts).

Lack of granularity results in notification fatigue and lower engagement.

Requested Feature

Add a Smart Notification Preferences screen where users can:

Toggle notification categories ON/OFF
(e.g., Reminders, Security Alerts, Promotions, Tips & Insights)

Set frequency preferences (e.g., Immediate, Daily Summary, Weekly Summary)

Enable “Do Not Disturb” hours

Optionally use AI to auto-configure based on user behavior

Expected Outcome

Users feel more in control of their notification flow.

Reduction in irrelevant notifications.

Higher app satisfaction and engagement.

Acceptance Criteria

User can access “Notification Preferences” from Settings.

Each category has a toggle switch.

“Do Not Disturb” has custom start/end time.

AI Auto-Configure button suggests optimal settings.

Preferences persist across sessions.

All UI elements follow existing design guidelines.
